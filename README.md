# ANDROID_MICRO_PROJECT

This is a repo for my Android Micro Project. It is a recharge system made to generate virtual fake money to a virtual wallet which will be validated on the mobile number used by the user. User can use the virtual money to recharge on the same number ( Fake recharge obvio. )

* Important notice : User should have sqlite3 installed on his device in order to view the database
